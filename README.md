The lauchvirus is a virus coded using vbs scripting. It can be used on Windows computers and executes files and duplicates them in the folder. It can crash your computer however if you know what you are doing it causes no harm. Do not use this software if your computer has any unsaved files on it. I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILIY FOR YOUR ACTIONS!
